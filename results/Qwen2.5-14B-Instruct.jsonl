We can see that $\\epsilon_{BC} = -1$, $\\epsilon_{CD} = \\epsilon_{BD} = 1$.\nThis indicates that $H$ is out of $\\triangle BCD$. To be specific, $H$ and $D$ are on opposite sides of $BC$, $H$ and $C$ are on the same side of $BD$, and $H$ and $B$ are on the same side of $CD$. \nNow, we compute the volume of the tetrahedron $ABCD$, denoted as $V$.

Place $AB$ on the floor. Construct an isosceles vertical triangle with $AB$ as its base and $M$ as the top vertex. Place $CD$ on the top vertex parallel to the ground with midpoint $M.$ Observe that $CD$ can rotate about its midpoint. At a certain angle, we observe that the lengths satisfy those given in the problem. If we project $AB$ onto the plane of $CD$, let the minor angle $\\theta$ be this discrepancy.\nBy Median formula or Stewart's theorem, $AM = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{2AC^2 + 2AD^2 - CD^2} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{33}}{2}.$ Consequently the area of $\\triangle AMB$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{41}}{2} \\left (\\sqrt{(\\frac{3\\sqrt{33}}{2})^2 - (\\frac{\\sqrt{41}}{2})^2} \\right ) = 4\\sqrt{41}.$ Note the altitude $8$ is also the distance between the parallel planes containing $AB$ and $CD.$\nBy Distance Formula,\n\\begin{align*} (\\frac{\\sqrt{41}}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}CD \\cos{\\theta})^2 + (\\frac{1}{2}CD \\sin{\\theta}^2) + (8)^2 &= AC^2 = 80 \\\\ (\\frac{\\sqrt{41}}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}CD \\cos{\\theta})^2 + (\\frac{1}{2}CD \\sin{\\theta}^2) + (8)^2 &= AD^2 = 89 \\\\ \\implies CD \\cos{\\theta} \\sqrt{41} &= 9 \\\\ \\sin{\\theta} &= \\sqrt{1 - (\\frac{9}{41})^2} = \\frac{40}{41}. \\end{align*}\nThen the volume of the tetrahedron is given by $\\frac{1}{3} [AMB] \\cdot CD \\sin{\\theta} = \\frac{160}{3}.$\nThe volume of the tetrahedron can also be segmented into four smaller tetrahedrons from $I$ w.r.t each of the faces. If $r$ is the inradius, i.e the distance to the faces, then $\\frac{1}{3} r([ABC] + [ABD] + [ACD] + [BCD])$ must the volume. Each face has the same area by SSS congruence, and by Heron's it is $\\frac{1}{4}\\sqrt{(a + b + c)(a + b - c)(c + (a-b))(c -(a - b))} = 6\\sqrt{21}.$\nTherefore the answer is, $\\dfrac{3 \\frac{160}{3}}{24 \\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{20\\sqrt{21}}{63} \\implies \\boxed{104}.$\n~Aaryabhatta1","split":"train","tools_kwargs":{"python_code_executor":{"create_kwargs":{"ground_truth":"test-solution-str"}},"rag_system_retrieve":{"create_kwargs":{"ground_truth":"test-solution-str"}}}},"responses":["To solve the problem, we need to calculate the distance from the incenter $I$ of the tetrahedron to one of its faces.
