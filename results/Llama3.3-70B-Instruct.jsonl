The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.","solution":"This is a conditional probability problem. Bayes' Theorem states that \n\\[P(A|B)=\\dfrac{P(B|A)\\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\\]\n\nin other words, the probability of $A$ given $B$ is equal to the probability of $B$ given $A$ times the probability of $A$ divided by the probability of $B$. In our case, $A$ represents the probability of winning the grand prize, and $B$ represents the probability of winning a prize. Clearly, $P(B|A)=1$, since by winning the grand prize you automatically win a prize. Thus, we want to find $\\dfrac{P(A)}{P(B)}$.\nLet us calculate the probability of winning a prize. We do this through casework: how many of Jen's drawn numbers match the lottery's drawn numbers? \nTo win a prize, Jen must draw at least $2$ numbers identical to the lottery. Thus, our cases are drawing $2$, $3$, or $4$ numbers identical. \nLet us first calculate the number of ways to draw exactly $2$ identical numbers to the lottery. Let Jen choose the numbers $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$; we have $\\dbinom42$ ways to choose which $2$ of these $4$ numbers are identical to the lottery. We have now determined $2$ of the $4$ numbers drawn in the lottery; since the other $2$ numbers Jen chose can not be chosen by the lottery, the lottery now has $10-2-2=6$ numbers to choose the last $2$ numbers from. Thus, this case is $\\dbinom62$, so this case yields $\\dbinom42\\dbinom62=6\\cdot15=90$ possibilities. \nNext, let us calculate the number of ways to draw exactly $3$ identical numbers to the lottery. Again, let Jen choose $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. This time, we have $\\dbinom43$ ways to choose the identical numbers and again $6$ numbers left for the lottery to choose from; however, since $3$ of the lottery's numbers have already been determined, the lottery only needs to choose $1$ more number, so this is $\\dbinom61$. This case yields $\\dbinom43\\dbinom61=4\\cdot6=24$. \nFinally, let us calculate the number of ways to all $4$ numbers matching. There is actually just one way for this to happen. \nIn total, we have $90+24+1=115$ ways to win a prize. The lottery has $\\dbinom{10}4=210$ possible combinations to draw, so the probability of winning a prize is $\\dfrac{115}{210}$. There is actually no need to simplify it or even evaluate $\\dbinom{10}4$ or actually even know that it has to be $\\dbinom{10}4$; it suffices to call it $a$ or some other variable, as it will cancel out later. However, let us just go through with this. The probability of winning a prize is $\\dfrac{115}{210}$. Note that the probability of winning a grand prize is just matching all $4$ numbers, which we already calculated to have $1$ possibility and thus have probability $\\dfrac1{210}$. Thus, our answer is $\\dfrac{\\frac1{210}}{\\frac{115}{210}}=\\dfrac1{115}$. Therefore, our answer is $1+115=\\boxed{116}$. \n~Technodoggo\nFor getting all $4$ right, there is only $1$ way.\nFor getting $3$ right, there is $\\dbinom43$ multiplied by $\\dbinom61$ = $24$ ways.\nFor getting $2$ right, there is $\\dbinom42$ multiplied by $\\dbinom62$ = $90$ ways.\n$\\frac{1}{1+24+90}$  = $\\frac{1}{115}$\nTherefore, the answer is $1+115 = \\boxed{116}$\n~e___","split":"train","tools_kwargs":{"python_code_executor":{"create_kwargs":{"ground_truth":"test-solution-str"}},"rag_system_retrieve":{"create_kwargs":{"ground_truth":"test-solution-str"}}}},"responses":["\n<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"python_code_executor\", \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"from math import comb\\n\\ntotal_ways = comb(10, 4)\\nwin_ways = comb(4, 2) * comb(6, 2) + comb(4, 3) * comb(6, 1) + comb(4, 4)\\ngrand_prize_ways = comb(4, 4)\\n\\nprobability = grand_prize_ways / win_ways\\nm, n = 1, 1\\n\\ndef gcd(a, b):\\n    while b:\\n        a, b = b, a % b\\n    return a\\nd = gcd(grand_prize_ways, win_ways)\\nm = grand_prize_ways // d\\nn = win_ways // d\\nprint(m + n)\", \"timeout\": 2000}}\n</tool_call>\n\nuser\n<tool_response>\nThe result of the code execution is: 116\n\n</tool_response>\nThe probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\\tfrac{1}{115}$, so $m+n=\\boxed{116}$."],"score_lst":[1],"judge":{"model":"Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct","score":8,"rationale":"The solution is correct and uses appropriate tools, but lacks explanation of the logic behind the code and the connection to the problem statement.","raw":"{\"score\": 8, \"rationale\": \"The solution is correct and uses appropriate tools, but lacks explanation of the logic behind the code and the connection to the problem statement.\"}"}}
