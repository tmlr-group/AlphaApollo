We can use elementary calculus for this, but to do so, we must put the expression in terms of one variable. Recall that $a^2+b^2=16$; thus, $b=\\pm\\sqrt{16-a^2}$. Notice that we have a $-108b$ in the expression; to maximize the expression, we want $b$ to be negative so that $-108b$ is positive and thus contributes more to the expression. We thus let $b=-\\sqrt{16-a^2}$. Let $f(a)=81a-108b$. We now know that $f(a)=81a+108\\sqrt{16-a^2}$, and can proceed with normal calculus. \n\\begin{align*}\nf(a)&=81a+108\\sqrt{16-a^2} \\\\\n&=27\\left(3a+4\\sqrt{16-a^2}\\right) \\\\\nf'(a)&=27\\left(3a+4\\sqrt{16-a^2}\\right)' \\\\\n&=27\\left(3+4\\left(\\sqrt{16-a^2}\\right)'\\right) \\\\\n&=27\\left(3+4\\left(\\dfrac{-2a}{2\\sqrt{16-a^2}}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n&=27\\left(3-4\\left(\\dfrac a{\\sqrt{16-a^2}}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n&=27\\left(3-\\dfrac{4a}{\\sqrt{16-a^2}}\\right). \\\\\n\\end{align*}\nWe want $f'(a)$ to be $0$ to find the maximum. \n\\begin{align*}\n0&=27\\left(3-\\dfrac{4a}{\\sqrt{16-a^2}}\\right) \\\\\n&=3-\\dfrac{4a}{\\sqrt{16-a^2}} \\\\\n3&=\\dfrac{4a}{\\sqrt{16-a^2}} \\\\\n4a&=3\\sqrt{16-a^2} \\\\\n16a^2&=9\\left(16-a^2\\right) \\\\\n16a^2&=144-9a^2 \\\\\n25a^2&=144 \\\\\na^2&=\\dfrac{144}{25} \\\\\na&=\\dfrac{12}5 \\\\\n&=2.4. \\\\\n\\end{align*}\nWe also find that $b=-\\sqrt{16-2.4^2}=-\\sqrt{16-5.76}=-\\sqrt{10.24}=-3.2$. \nThus, the expression we wanted to maximize becomes $81\\cdot2.4-108(-3.2)=81\\cdot2.4+108\\cdot3.2=\\boxed{540}$. \n~Technodoggo\nSame steps as solution one until we get $\\text{Re}(w)=81a-108b$. We also know $|z|=4$ or $a^2+b^2=16$. We want to find the line $81a-108b=k$ tangent to circle $a^2+b^2=16$.\nUsing $\\frac{|ax+by+c|}{\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}=r$ we can substitute and get $\\frac{|81(0)-108(0)-k|}{\\sqrt{81^2+108^2}}=4$\n\\begin{align*} \\frac{k}{\\sqrt{18225}}&=4 \\\\\\frac{k}{135}&=4 \\\\k&=\\boxed{540} \\end{align*}\n~BH2019MV0\nFollow Solution 1 to get $81a-108b$. We can let $a=4\\cos\\theta$ and $b=4\\sin\\theta$ as $|z|=4$, and thus we have $324\\cos\\theta-432\\sin\\theta$. Furthermore, we can ignore the negative sign in front of the second term as we are dealing with sine and cosine, so we finally wish to maximize $324\\cos\\theta+432\\sin\\theta$ for obviously positive $\\cos\\theta$ and $\\sin\\theta$.\n\nUsing the previous fact, we can use the [Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Cauchy-Schwarz_Inequality) to calculate the maximum. By the inequality, we have:\n$(324^2+432^2)(\\cos^2\\theta+\\sin^2\\theta)\\ge(324\\cos\\theta+432\\sin\\theta)^2$\n$540^2\\cdot1\\ge(324\\cos\\theta+432\\sin\\theta)^2$\n$\\boxed{540}\\ge324\\cos\\theta+432\\sin\\theta$\n~eevee9406\nSimilar to the solutions above, we find that $Re((75+117i)z+\\frac{96+144i}{z})=81a-108b=27(3a-4b)$, where $z=a+bi$. To maximize this expression, we must maximize $3a-4b$. Let this value be $x$. Solving for $a$ yields $a=\\frac{x+4b}{3}$. From the given information we also know that $a^2+b^2=16$. Substituting $a$ in terms of $x$ and $b$ gives us $\\frac{x^2+8bx+16b^2}{9}+b^2=16$. Combining fractions, multiplying, and rearranging, gives $25b^2+8xb+(x^2-144)=0$. This is useful because we want the maximum value of $x$ such that this quadratic has real roots which is easy to find using the discriminant. For the roots to be real, $(8x)^2-4(25)(x^2-144) \\ge 0$. Now all that is left to do is to solve this inequality. Simplifying this expression, we get $-36x^2+14400 \\ge 0$ which means $x^2 \\le 400$ and $x \\le 20$. Therefore the maximum value of $x$ is $20$ and $27 \\cdot 20 = \\boxed{540}$\n~vsinghminhas\nFirst, recognize the relationship between the reciprocal of a complex number $z$ with its conjugate $\\overline{z}$, namely:\n\\[\\frac{1}{z} \\cdot \\frac{\\overline{z}}{\\overline{z}} = \\frac{\\overline{z}}{|z|^2} = \\frac{\\overline{z}}{16}\\]\nThen, let $z = 4(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta)$ and $\\overline{z} = 4(\\cos\\theta - i\\sin\\theta)$.\n\\begin{align*} Re \\left ((75+117i)z+\\frac{96+144i}{z} \\right) &= Re\\left ( (75+117i)z + (6+9i)\\overline{z}    \\right ) \\\\                                                &= 4 \\cdot Re\\left ( (75+117i)(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta) + (6+9i)(\\cos\\theta - i\\sin\\theta)    \\right ) \\\\                                                &= 4 \\cdot (75\\cos\\theta - 117\\sin\\theta + 6\\cos\\theta + 9\\sin\\theta) \\\\                                                &= 4 \\cdot (81\\cos\\theta - 108\\sin\\theta) \\\\                                                &= 4\\cdot 27 \\cdot (3\\cos\\theta - 4\\sin\\theta) \\end{align*}\nNow, recognizing the 3 and 4 coefficients hinting at a 3-4-5 right triangle, we \"complete the triangle\" by rewriting our desired answer in terms of an angle of that triangle $\\phi$ where $\\cos\\phi = \\frac{3}{5}$ and $\\sin\\phi = \\frac{4}{5}$\n\\begin{align*} 4\\cdot 27 \\cdot(3\\cos\\theta - 4\\sin\\theta) &= 4\\cdot 27 \\cdot 5 \\cdot (\\frac{3}{5}\\cos\\theta - \\frac{4}{5}\\sin\\theta) \\\\                                                &= 540 \\cdot (\\cos\\phi\\cos\\theta - \\sin\\phi\\sin\\theta) \\\\                                                &= 540 \\cos(\\theta + \\phi) \\end{align*}\nSince the simple trig ratio is bounded above by 1, our answer is $\\boxed{540}$\n~ Cocoa @ [https://www.corgillogical.com/](https://artofproblemsolving.comhttps://www.corgillogical.com/)\n(yes i am a corgi that does math)\nFollow as solution 1 would to obtain $81a + 108\\sqrt{16-a^2}.$\nBy the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, we have\n\\[(a^2 + (\\sqrt{16-a^2})^2)(81^2 + 108^2) \\geq (81a + 108\\sqrt{16-a^2})^2,\\]\nso \n\\[4^2 \\cdot 9^2 \\cdot 15^2 \\geq (81a + 108\\sqrt{16-a^2})^2\\]\nand we obtain that $81a + 108\\sqrt{16-a^2} \\leq 4 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 15 = \\boxed{540}.$\n\n- [spectraldragon8](https://artofproblemsolving.comhttps://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/User:Spectraldragon8)\nFollow solution 2 to get that we want to find the line $81a-108b=k$ tangent to circle $a^2+b^2=16$.
